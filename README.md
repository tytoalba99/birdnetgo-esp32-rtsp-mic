# ESP32 RTSP Mic for BirdNET-Go

ESP32-C6 + I2S MEMS microphone streamer that exposes a **mono 16-bit PCM** audio stream over
**RTSP**, designed as a simple network mic for **BirdNET-Go**.

- Latest firmware: **v1.6.0-le.1** (2026-03-06)
- Target firmware: `esp32_rtsp_mic_birdnetgo` (Web UI + JSON API)
- Changelog: `esp32_rtsp_mic_birdnetgo/CHANGELOG.md`
- One-click web flasher (recommended): **https://esp32mic.msmeteo.cz**
  (Chrome/Edge desktop, USB-C *data* cable)

## Quick Start (EN)

1. Open **https://esp32mic.msmeteo.cz**.
2. Click **Flash**, select the USB JTAG/serial device, wait for reboot.
3. On first boot the device starts AP **ESP32-RTSP-Mic-AP** (open).
   Connect and finish Wi-Fi setup at `192.168.4.1` (captive portal).
4. Open the Web UI: `http://<device-ip>/` (port **80**).
5. RTSP stream (BirdNET-Go/VLC/ffplay):
   `rtsp://<device-ip>:8554/audio` (or `rtsp://esp32mic.local:8554/audio` if mDNS is enabled).

## Wiring (XIAO ESP32-C6 + ICS-43434)

![Wiring / pinout](connection.png)

| ICS-43434 signal | XIAO ESP32-C6 GPIO | Notes |
|---|:--:|---|
| **BCLK / SCK** | **21** | I2S bit clock |
| **LRCLK / WS** | **1** | I2S word select |
| **SD (DOUT)** | **2** | I2S data out from mic |
| **VDD** | 3V3 | Power |
| **GND** | GND | Ground |

Tips:
- Keep I2S wires short; for longer runs use shielded cable to reduce EMI.
- Some XIAO ESP32-C6 revisions use an RF switch (GPIO3/GPIO14). If you use a different board or
  internal antenna only, you may need to comment out the antenna GPIO block in `setup()`.

## Test The RTSP Audio

- VLC: *Media* → *Open Network Stream* → paste the RTSP URL.
- ffplay:
  `ffplay -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://<device-ip>:8554/audio`
- ffprobe:
  `ffprobe -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://<device-ip>:8554/audio`

If VLC/ffplay works, BirdNET-Go will typically work too (just use the same RTSP URL as your input).

## Highlights (v1.6.0-le.1)

- Web UI (English) on port **80** with live status, logs, and controls
- JSON API for automation
- MQTT + Home Assistant Discovery: richer diagnostics entities (boot reason/counter, Wi-Fi reconnect count, stream uptime/client count, firmware build)
- MQTT publish interval configurable in UI/API (default `60 s`, range `10..3600`) with immediate event-driven state publish
- Stream schedule (start/stop local time) with overnight window support (for example `22:00-06:00`)
- Fail-open schedule policy when time is unavailable (stream stays allowed instead of blocking)
- Schedule edge-case rule: `Start == Stop` is an explicit empty window (stream blocked always)
- Time & Network UI extended with stream schedule controls, status, and help tooltips
- Time & Network UI shows current Local time, UTC time, and applied time offset
- Optional deep sleep outside the stream schedule window (conservative mode + double-confirm enable in UI)
- Deep sleep safety policy: never sleeps when time is unsynced, during startup grace, or with active stream/client
- Max one deep-sleep cycle is 8 hours (for lower wake-up overhead / better solar use)
- Deep sleep wakes with a 5-minute guard before stream window to reduce RTC-drift edge issues
- After deep-sleep timer wake, logs include retained sleep snapshot (cycle, planned sleep, entered time, schedule, offset)
- Logs panel keeps manual scroll position when reading older logs (auto-follows only near bottom)
- Mobile UI: top header/RTSP links now wrap correctly (no horizontal overflow scrollbar)
- Auto-recovery (manual/auto packet-rate thresholds)
- Scheduled reset, CPU frequency control
- Thermal protection with latch + acknowledge
- High-pass filter (HPF) configurable (reduce rumble)
- RTSP keep-alive (`GET_PARAMETER`), single client
- **[New] RTSP OFF Idle Mode:** when RTSP server is stopped, I2S is shut down, CPU drops to 80 MHz, and Wi-Fi modem sleep (`MIN_MODEM`) is activated — Web UI and MQTT remain responsive; full state is restored on server start
- **[New] Adaptive Wi-Fi TX Power:** optional mode that automatically adjusts TX power (5–18.5 dBm) based on measured RSSI every 30 s — backs off when signal is excellent (> -65 dBm), restores max power immediately when signal is poor (< -78 dBm); current level shown in status and MQTT (`wifi_tx_dbm`, `wifi_tx_adaptive`)

Notes:
- Links are provided for convenience and may change over time. Always verify the exact part number
  (for example **ICS-43434**) in the listing before buying.

## Tips & Best Practices

- RTSP is **single-client** (only one connection at a time).
- Wi-Fi: aim for RSSI > -75 dBm; try buffer >= 512 for stability.
- Placement: keep the mic away from fans/EMI; shielded cable helps for longer runs.
- Security: keep the device on a trusted LAN; do not expose HTTP/RTSP to the public internet.

### High-Pass Filter (Reduce Low-Frequency Rumble)

- Default: ON at 500 Hz (since v1.4.0).
- Typical cutoff range: 300-800 Hz depending on your environment.
- UI: Web UI -> Audio -> `High-pass` + `HPF Cutoff`.
- API:
  - Enable/disable: `POST /api/set` with body `key=hp_enable&value=on|off`
  - Set cutoff (Hz): `POST /api/set` with body `key=hp_cutoff&value=600`
  - For mutating calls, send header `X-ESP32MIC-CSRF: 1` (used by Web UI).

## Compatibility

- **Target board:** ESP32-C6 (tested with Seeed XIAO ESP32-C6).
- Other ESP32 variants may work with pin/I2S tweaks.
- Other I2S mics may be possible, but **ICS-43434** is the supported/tested reference.
